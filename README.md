# Eye_disease_classification_using_machine_learning
This project aimed at developing a system that can identify eye diseases from fundus images.  My project focuses on binary classification of uveitis. which consists of Cataract and Glaucoma, The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a ML technique to extract features from the images &amp; Gradient Boosting used for classification
